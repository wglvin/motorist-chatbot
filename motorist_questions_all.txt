Question: Do I Get Any Penalty For Early Settlement Of My Outstanding?
Answer: Early redemption amount for car loans in Singapore is calculated based on the Rule of 78, which is a method of allocating the interest charge on a loan across its payment periods. More interest charge is allocated to earlier payments compared to the later ones. Because of this, paying off a loan early will result in the borrower paying more interest overall. Because the banks need to cover their administrative costs and commission already paid out, car owners who early redeem their loans are further penalised with a charge of 20 percent of the unpaid interest; the bank will only rebate the borrower 80 percent of the unpaid interest instead of the full sum. Banks usually further charge an Early Settlement Penalty, but in our below example, we will ignore this portion. When doing an early redemption on a car loan, the amount to pay is: Initial loan amount + total interest - instalments already paid - 80 percent of unpaid interest

Question: Are Alloy Rims Allowed For Commercial Vehicles?
Answer: Yes, we allow alloy rims that are originally factory-fitted to the vehicle and come with a certification from the vehicle manufacturer. These alloy rims have undergone testing by the vehicle manufacturer and have shown to comply with internationally recognised standards. We also allow retrofitting of after-market alloy rims on in-use light commercial vehicles with a Maximum Laden Weight (MLW) of not more than 3,500 kg (e.g. vans, pickups, small buses and lorries) so long as it does not adversely affect the safe operation of the vehicles. The rims and tyres fitted onto theses vehicles must be of the correct width, diameter and profile as recommended and certified safe for road use by the rim manufacturer. This is because, if the rims and tyres used do not follow the recommended specifications, vehicle performance may be affected. As a result, road safety would be compromised. The alloy rims must be tested by the rim manufacturer to show compliance with internationally recognised standards that they would not adversely affect the performance and safe operation of the vehicles.

Question: Are After Market Light Bulbs Legal To Be Used For Vehicles?
Answer: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) requires all designs of vehicle lights, including HID lights, to comply with the Road Traffic (Motor Vehicles, Lighting) Rules. They must bear approved markings to show that they comply with internationally recognised standards, such as those adopted in the European Union countries, Japan and the United States. The lights must also conform to their illuminated colour and intensity. For headlamps, the LTA requires every unit fitted on the vehicle to be capable of casting a white light to the front of the vehicle. The intensity and alignment of a headlamp must also be within the specified limits. The colour temperature of headlamps that bear approved markings should not exceed 4000K. We have, in principle, no objection to the use of after-market light bulbs on vehicles so long as such bulbs comply with the above requirements and are suitable for use on the vehicle concerned. We have evaluated some of OSRAM and Philips light bulb products for vehicles and have no objection to the use of OSRAM Silverstar, OSRAM Cool Blue, Philips Blue Vision, Philips Silver Vision and Philips Vision Plus as these models comply with ECE Regulation and bear the ECE markings. If vehicle owners intend to install after-market bulbs on the vehicles, we would advise them to consult the local agents for the models that are suitable for the vehicles. It is the responsibility of vehicle owners to ensure that their vehicle headlamps are properly aligned after replacing the bulbs so as not to cause glare and distraction to other road users; and that such bulbs do not exceed the wattage rating recommended by the vehicle manufacturer.

Question: What Is A Temporary Transfer?
Answer: Motor Dealers on the Temporary Transfer of Vehicle Scheme 1) Motor trade users on the Temporary Transfer scheme are reminded that from 28 February 2006: They must use their Electronic Service Agent (ESA) account (i.e. login to LTALink with their Netrust Token) to temporarily transfer a vehicle to their name in order to enjoy the exemption from ATF. This requires a Transaction PIN from the vehicle owner; The transfer of a Temporary Transfer scheme vehicle out of their account does not require a Transaction PIN. They can merely login to LTALink with their Netrust Token and transfer the vehicle to the buyer. This also applies to rebates registered to their account. Under the Temporary Transfer of Vehicle Scheme, licensed motor trade dealers or hire purchase companies could, for a transfer fee of $10, assume temporary ownership of 3 months for vehicles that were bought for resale or were repossessed from hirers respectively. Such dealers or hire purchase companies have up to 3 months from the first temporary transfer date to effect a permanent transfer of vehicle to a buyer; otherwise an extension of another 3 months of temporary ownership will be granted at an extension fee of $30 (deducted from the dealer's nominated GIRO account). Upon expiry of the 6-month temporary ownership period, a further 3-month extension in the temporary ownership period will be granted with a payment of a fee of $60 (deducted from the dealer's nominated GIRO account). A further 3-month extension in the temporary ownership scheme with a payment of a fee of $60 (deducted from the dealer's nominated GIRO account), up to a maximum of 12 months, will be granted to vehicles: i) whose temporary ownership start date is on or after 7 March 2013; or ii) whose 9-month temporary ownership period expires on or after 7 March 2013

Question: Should I Buy A Parf Car Or A Coe Car?
Answer: If you want to buy something cheaper that’ll last for a few years until you upgrade to something better, get a COE Car. If you want something less vintage that’ll let you collect your COE and PARF rebates after de-registration, get a PARF car. But this is only a surface-level difference. Here’s the main reason why PARF and COE car prices differ: A PARF car hasn’t been de-registered before its 10-year depreciation period has ended. This makes it eligible for both the COE and PARF Rebate, which ranges from 50% – 75% of the Additional Registration Fee (ARF) paid on the vehicle. A COE car is not eligible for the PARF Rebate because the owner chose to pay the Prevailing Quota Premium (PQP) for 5 or 10 more years more instead of de-registering the vehicle. This means that upon de-registration, you’ll only receive the COE Rebate. There are many other differences between PARF and COE cars that contribute to both their upfront and long-term cost, such as: The down payment makes up the biggest chunk of your upfront cost when buying a used car. And with the latest MAS car loan restrictions, the amount you can borrow is reduced – meaning you’ll have to pay a larger down payment. So your down payment will depend on the following: If the Open Market Value (OMV) of your vehicle is $20,000 or less, your maximum Loan-to-Value is 60% – meaning you’ll have to make a 40% down payment. Almost all COE cars will fit into this category. If the Open Market Value (OMV) of your vehicle is more than $20,000, your maximum Loan-to-Value is 50% – meaning you’ll have to make a 50% down payment. Most PARF cars will fit into this category. The rebates associated with both PARF and COE cars is where used cars get much of their value from. COE cars are the cheapest used cars you can buy because you’ll only get the COE rebate. PARF cars on the other hand are much more expensive because upon de-registration, you get both the PARF and COE discounts.

You’ll need to consider what’s known as the On-the-road (OTR) price. On top of the RRP, this also includes the delivery charge (which varies from manufacturer to manufacturer) Plus the cost of half a tank of fuel, the car’s number plates, Road tax (which varies depending on the car’s CO2 emissions), and the First Registration Fee, which is set by the Government.

Question: Are Passengers Allowed In The Cargo Deck Compartment Of?
Answer: Goods vehicles should be used primarily for the carriage of goods. To help manage business costs, the Road Traffic Act provides an exception for owners and hirers of goods vehicles, including goods vans, to use their vehicles to transport their workers to and from their places of work or business so long as they comply with various safety requirements. Goods vans are generally not used for the mass transport of workers for commute trips and are observed to be used more by the specialist trade for the transport of goods or equipment as well as some attendants. We recognise that there could be some occasions where the owner or hirer of the goods van needs to use his van to transport his workers. As part of the safety requirement, the owner or hirer of the goods van must display a Maximum Passenger Capacity (MPC) label on the vehicle indicating the maximum number of workers that can be transported on the cargo deck of the vehicle. The MPC label serves as a reminder to the vehicle owner, hirer and driver of the maximum number of workers that the vehicle can carry on the cargo deck of the vehicle as well as facilitates enforcement against errant employers. When determining the maximum passenger capacity of a cargo deck, the usable deck area should not include the area occupied by any permanent fixtures on the cargo deck such as cranes, toolboxes, etc. If goods are also transported, the number of persons should be reduced accordingly. The MPC is calculated based on the total unoccupied deck area divided by the area of 0.372 square metres (4 square feet) per person, round down to the nearest whole number. The vehicle is not allowed to exceed its loading capacity or travel faster than the vehicle speed limit of 60 km/h or the stipulated road speed limit. Owner or hirer of goods van should also ensure that the van is fitted with proper air-conditioning or mechanical ventilation system so as to provide adequate comfort for the workers transported. The onus would be on the owner/driver to ensure the safety and welfare of the workers transported.

For a new motorist who is under one-year probation from the date of grant of his driving licence, his new driving licence will be revoked and become invalid when he accumulates 13 or more demerit points during his probationary period. The licence holder will have to retake all the necessary driving tests (theory and practical) to obtain a licence to drive/ride again.

Question: What Are The Things That I Should Look Out For If I Am?
Answer: There are several things you should know before you decide to renew your COE - 1. You will have to forgo your PARF Rebate The Parf Rebate is the the amount of money you get back from the Government once you deregister your car, and is also known as the scrap value. This is something to consider if your car's PARF value is fairly significant. 2. You will need to pay the PQP This is the moving average of the COE prices over the last three months. Your PQP will be based on the respective category that your vehicle belongs in. 3. You can renew your COE for 5 years, but that makes it non-renewable. There is an option of renewing your car's COE for just five years instead of 10, for which you simply pay half of the PQP at the point of renewal. This might be a more financially sound option for those who may not have as much ready cash for a full 10-year COE renewal, but bear in mind that if you opt for a five-year renewal, you will be unable to extend the car's lifespan any further once the COE's tenure is up. A 10-year COE can be renewed in perpetuity, however. Do take note that commercial vehicles have a statutory lifespan of 20 years, and you cannot renew its COE for any further than that. 4. There is an additional surcharge on Road Tax for cars over 10 years. This amount is chargeable at an amount of 10 percent over the car's regular road tax rate per annum, up to a maximum of 50 percent. For a car with a large capacity engine, the increase in costs can grow to be quite significant. 5. You will suffer less depreciation on your car after renewal Renewing your car's COE will always be more financially accessible than buying a new car, as you'll only pay the cost of the new COE. Therefore, the resulting depreciation over the next 10 years will be significantly less than if you've purchased a new car. 6. You will forfeit the remaining balance of your COE rebate upon renewal Aside from the PARF value, the LTA also offers a rebate on any 'unused' value of your current COE if you deregister it before the full 10-year tenure is up. However, should you renew your COE before it reaches its expiry date, you will forfeit any COE rebate that you are eligible for. It is for this reason that most people tend to renew their COEs very close to the expiry date, or even on the day itself, in order to minimise the 'loss' of this rebate. 7. Your renewed COE car is still eligible for COE rebates upon deregistration While a car with a revalidated COE is no longer eligible for PARF rebates, it is still eligible for a rebate on the renewed COE. What this means is that, should you scrap or deregister your car before your renewed COE is up, you will be refunded the pro-rated amount of the COE remaining. For example, if you renew your car's COE for 10 years at $50,000, and you decide to scrap it exactly five years later, you will get back $25,000 in COE rebates upon deregistration. It is a point worth considering as it means your COE-renewed car does have some residual value even after renewal. 8. You can take a loan for COE renewal There are banks and financial institutions that allow you to take loans to renew your COE. They aren't that common, but a quick search reveals that some do offer loan quantum of up to 70 percent over seven years, at an interest rate of 3.25 percent, for COE re-validations. Financial institutions, such as Hong Leong Finance, Tokyo Century Leasing and United Overseas Bank, may offer different rates so it pays to do your research. 9. You can get comprehensive insurance coverage for a COE car A common myth is that COE-renewed cars (or COE cars) are ineligible for comprehensive insurance coverage. In actual fact, it is actually possible to get comprehensive insurance for such cars, although it is indeed harder to source. However, if you take a loan for COE renewal from some finance companies, they may require that you obtain comprehensive insurance cover for your car as part of their terms and conditions.

Question: Is Vehicle Inspection Compulsory If I Decide To Renew My?
Answer: Usually, you will be reminded by LTA to do an inspection when your road tax is due for renewal. However, as your COE is expiring, LTA will not know if you are looking to renew the COE or scrap the car, so a letter for inspection will not be sent to you. Therefore it is not compulsory to get your vehicle checked before renewing COE, however you still must do your vehicle inspection before your road tax renewal.

Question: How Does Car Trade In Works?
Answer: Trade-in happens when you sell your old car, and buy your new car, usually, only with the same dealer. During a trade-in, the dealer buys your old car, and uses this amount to offset from the price of the new car that you are going to buy from him. Trade-in can be one of the fastest and easiest way to buy and sell your car. However, you may not be getting the best price for the old car you are selling. It is always better to have a second opinion, either by asking other dealers or through independent quotation platforms like Motorist.sg. Also, as you have to buy and sell from the same dealer, you are likely to have limited options for your new car. With Motorist.sg, now you more choices and our consultants will help you pair up with our partners to get the best deal!

Question: What Is The Difference Between Parallel Importer And?
Answer: Authorised Distributors (AD) are companies that have won exclusive distribution rights for a particular car brand from the manufacturer of the vehicle. For example, the authorised distributor for Nissan cars is Tan Chong Motors, and that for Toyota cars is Borneo Motors. Parallel Importers (PI) purchase directly from the factories producing the vehicles and then import them to Singapore. Parallel importing of cars is perfectly legal. Parallel importers do not have any limitation on the brand of vehicles they can retail, unlike authorised distributors who can only sell the make of vehicle they are representing. The addition of parallel importers give consumers more choices and promotes competition.  http://www.sgcarmart.com/news/writeup.php?AID=2

Question: I Made A Slight Bump Into Another Car While Parking In My?
Answer: Hi Ajay, thank you for leaving a question. What to do when you hit a car in a parking lot? 1. First, stop your car, don’t flee after the damage has been done. Stay calm and breathe. 2. Don't hit and run. Start by tracking down the owner of the car you’ve damaged. 3. If you are unable to locate the damaged vehicle’s owner, leave a note, containing an apology, your name, your phone number, and an explanation of what happened. 4. Take pictures of both vehicles and note the damaged car’s information (license plate number, make/model, unique characteristics, etc). 5. If it’s more than a scratch, you should probably file a police report. While most law enforcement won’t actually come to the scene physically, they may still take your information for an accident report. You can also find a security guard that patrols the parking lot and have them write up an incident report. 6. Call your insurance provider as soon as you can, even if you’re not planning to make a claim. Give them the details, along with any photos, and the contact details of any witnesses.

Question: What Is Early Turnover Scheme Ets?
Answer: The Early Turnover Scheme (ETS) is an incentive to encourage vehicle owners to replace their diesel vehicles with more eco-friendly vehicles like hybrid-electric vehicles. To qualify for ETS, the vehicles owner have to deregister his/her existing vehicle, and within one month, replace it with another eligible eco-friendly vehicle. He/she does not need to bid for COE for the new vehicle and instead, gets to enjoy a discounted Prevailing Quota Premium (PQP). Important thing to note is that the bonus is pro-rated, proportionate to the number of remaining COE that is unused. Basically, the earlier you replace your vehicle, the more COE is unused, and you get to enjoy a bigger discounted PQP when you purchase your new vehicle.

For example, a buyer of a $100,000 new car will need to put down at least $40,000 as downpayment. In overtrade, the seller will rise the car price to $110,000, and at the same time giving $10,000 more than what the trade-in car is worth. Even though the buyer now needs to pay $44,000 for his downpayment, he will receive an additional $10,000 more for his trade in. Effectively, he only needs to fork out $34,000 for his initial payment.

Meaning, all outstanding loans have to be paid up before the scrap or reregistration process can take place. If you still have outstanding loans when your car's COE is expiring, Motorist.sg can help you by having our partners settle the loan on your behalf with your PARF & COE rebates, which are usually more than enough so you will not need to top up with cash. When you scrap your car yourself, you have to pay up the loan in cash first as LTA will usually only refund you the rebates about 3 weeks later.

Answer: Larger wheel sizes, though they add a certain aesthetic appeal, are not generally helpful in increasing or maintaining efficient fuel economies. The larger wheel sizes increase the weight of the vehicle overall, taking more fuel to power it than it would with smaller tires. Having larger wheels also means there is a wider width which in turn creates an increased rolling resistance. As the rolling resistance increases, the engine has to work harder and use more fuel to move the tire.

Question: What Does Car Consignment Mean?
Answer: Car consignment is a method of selling your car, while having the flexibility of still owning your car. Some owners prefer selling their car themselves as they believe they can fetch a higher price and still able to drive the car until the sale is confirmed. However, it can become a lengthy and troublesome process, with lots of paperwork and wasted time meeting potential buyers. With Car consignment, owners get to enjoy the benefits (potentially fetch a higher price, drive the car till the sales is confirmed, etc...) without the trouble. This is because the consignment agents typically help you to handle the paperwork, and even screen through the potential buyers for those who are genuine and not just shopping around. The fees typically ranges from $500 onwards, depending on the type of vehicle, and is negotiable on a case by case basis. If you are looking to consign your vehicle, for a start, you can get a quick valuation of your vehicle here: http://www.motorist.sg/sell-car. They can also advise you on which sales process is the most suitable for you.

Question: Should I Send My Vehicle For Inspection Before Renewal Of?
Answer: Hi Richard Henry, thank you for your question. Before you can renew your road tax, you have to meet these prerequisites: 1. Vehicle insurance coverage Make sure your vehicle is covered by insurance for the entire period you are paying road tax. The vehicle insurance must cover third-party liability for deaths and bodily injury. It is a serious offence for a vehicle to be driven without insurance coverage. 2. Vehicle inspection (if one is due) If your vehicle is due for periodic inspection, you will receive an inspection notice about 3 months before your road tax expires. If you have misplaced your inspection notice, you can still get your vehicle inspected at LTA-Authorised Inspection Centres without it. 3. Outstanding fines from LTA, HDB, URA and Traffic Police (TP) If your vehicle has outstanding fines or warrants from LTA, HDB, URA and TP, it may prevent you from renewing your road tax. To renew your road tax smoothly, ensure that your vehicle has no outstanding fines or warrants with these agencies.

Question: Why Is My Quot Check Engine Quot Light On?
Answer: If the check engine light comes on: Look for a serious problem that requires immediate attention. Check your dashboard gauges and lights for indications of low oil pressure or overheating. These conditions mean you should pull over and shut off the engine as soon as you can find a safe place to do so. Try tightening your gas cap. This often solves the problem. Keep in mind that it may take several trips before the light resets. Some vehicles have a separate indicator that warns of a loose gas cap before the condition sets off the check engine light. Reduce speed and load. If the check engine light is blinking or you notice any serious performance problems, such as a loss of power, reduce your speed and try to reduce the load on the engine. For example, it would be a good idea to stop towing a trailer. Have the car checked as soon as possible to prevent expensive damage. Have the code read and the problem fixed. Take the vehicle to a professional. Some automotive parts stores will read and interpret the code for you. However, unless there is an easy solution to the problem, you should have the vehicle diagnosed by a qualified service technician directly tell what's wrong, so you have to test to find the real culprit. This is where the real meaning of codes comes into play. The only thing a code really indicates is which system or circuit to test in order to isolate the actual problem.

Question: What Is Omv And Arf Value What Does It Mean If Both Of?
Answer: The listed OMV value is that of the first registration date of the vehicle. OMV stands for Open Market Value. OMV is assessed by the Singapore Customs, based on the price actually paid or payable for the goods when sold for export to the country of importation. The Additional Registration Fee (ARF) is a tax imposed upon registration of a vehicle. It is calculated based on a percentage of the Open Market Value (OMV) of the vehicle. The ARF determines your PARF rebate which is a component of your de-registration value. — At the end of 10 years you will get back the minimum PARF rebate, which is usually 50% of the ARF paid. The PARF rebate is computed based on the age of the car at de-registration. The age of the car is computed from the date of its registration in Singapore or its original registration in a foreign country, whichever is earlier. You can also check the PARF amount here: 1. Go to https://www.onemotoring.com.sg/content/onemotoring/en.html 2. Click on Quick access > eServices & Info > COE/PARF > PARF/COE rebate on Deregistration. 3. Enter Carplate 4.

Answer: Advertising price does not equate to purchase price and selling price.

Question: What Happens If I Cancel My Car Insurance Policy?
Answer: Hello! Do check the terms and conditions of your existing car insurance policy to find out what happens if you cancel it. Generally, if you cancel it before it is time to renew, the insurer will pocket about 30% of the unused portion of your insurance, leaving only about 70% as a refund for you. If you can, wait until your car insurance is up for renewal. Then you'll have the freedom to switch to any insurer you like without any penalty. By the way, you may not always be the one walking away from a car insurance policy. There are also situations where your insurer might decide to drop you (sometimes with no refund at all) if they think there's foul play or illegal modifications going on.

Question: What Are The Consequences Of Modifying My Car Illegally?
Answer: From 1 November 2015, vehicle owners caught with illegally modified engines or exhaust systems in their vehicles for a second or subsequent time will be subjected to more frequent mandatory vehicle inspections. 2 Under this enhanced inspection regime, second-time offenders will be required to bring their vehicles for mandatory inspections every six months for a period of two years, while third-time or subsequent offenders will need to bring their vehicles for mandatory inspections every three months for a period of two years. This represents a more stringent inspection regime as compared to that for normal vehicles, which are typically inspected once every one or two years, depending on their age and type. Any owner who does not comply with the inspection regime is guilty of an offence and can be fined up to $1,000 or jailed for up to three months on conviction for the first offence. On conviction for a second or subsequent offence of failing to comply, the maximum penalty will be doubled. 3 The enhanced inspection regime will complement existing penalties to deter motorists from modifying their vehicle engines or exhaust systems illegally. Any person who is convicted of an illegal modification can be fined up to $2,000 or jailed for up to three months, for the first offence. Repeat offenders can be fined up to $5,000 or jailed up to six months. In addition, if a vehicle is found with a tampered engine, it will need to be deregistered and the owner may not be granted the rebates for the residual Certificates of Entitlement (COE) and Preferential Additional Registration Fee (PARF), if any. Consequences of Illegal Modifications 4 The Land Transport Authority (LTA) takes a serious view of such illegal modifications, as an illegally modified engine or exhaust system can create serious safety and environmental hazards. Once a vehicle’s engine or exhaust system is modified without due certification and approval, the existing vehicle components may not be able to handle the increased power or speed. Such modifications may also affect the durability and reliability of a vehicle. 5 Currently, motorists may choose to legally install after-market exhaust systems that are certified to be suitable for the specific vehicle make and model. These exhaust systems which are specifically designed and engineered for a particular vehicle make and model will have undergone testing, either by the vehicle manufacturer or by independent test laboratories, to ensure compliance with internationally recognised standards. 6 More information on vehicle modification guidelines can be found at LTA’s One.Motoring website at LTA Information & Guidelines/Common Vehicle Modifications & Vehicle-Related Offences. Vehicle owners may also contact LTA’s hotline at 1800-225-5582 for further information and assistance.

If you are caught with too little petrol, you will be told to drive back to Singapore to top-up your petrol, and you can be fined up to $500 for ignoring this rule. The risk of leaving Singapore with low tank is that your car might run out of petrol and you might be stranded in the middle of a massive causeway jam. Nobody wants that right? Therefore, ensure that your tank is at least three-quarter full before heading to Johor.

Question: When Will My Demerit Points Be Reseted?
Answer: -1 Under the Driver Improvement Point System (DIPS), any demerit points will be erased if the driver remains free from traffic offences for the 12 months following his last offence. Any suspensions would also be wiped off his/her driving record if he remains free from traffic offences for two years from the time his licence was suspended. However, if the period of driving suspension is one year or longer, he/she will have to earn it back later on by passing the theory and practical exams all over again. The best incentive will be the Certificate of Merit, issued to every motorist who maintains a clean driving record consecutively for three years. This reward entitles him/her to a five percent discount on his/her motor insurance premium upon renewal, on top of any No-Claim Bonus, provided his/her insurer participates in the above-mentioned scheme and he/she did not file any policy claims in the last three years.

If you are referring to transfer the retained vehicle registration number to another motorcycle that you owned, You can apply to retain the carplate of your vehicle before the vehicle is de-registered. All outstanding fees/taxes/charges (if any) must be settled first. A retained number is non-transferable. The vehicle owner can use the retained number to: (a) Register a new vehicle in his/her name at $100; or (b) Replace the registration number on an existing vehicle registered in his/her name at $1,300. Once a vehicle registration number is retained, it cannot be cancelled and any fee paid is non-refundable. The retained number is valid for 12 months from the date of approval of the retention application.

Question: What Is The Right Tyre Pressure For My Vehicle?
Answer: You’ll find the manufacturer’s optimum or recommended tire pressure for your car on a sticker in the door jam, or in your owner’s manual. Some models even place the stickers on the trunk lid, in the console or on the fuel door. Recommended pressure is usually between 30 and 35 PSI. That number indicates the minimum amount of air pressure needed to support your vehicle’s maximum load-carrying capacity. Any less, and you’ll see poor fuel economy and handling as well as premature wear from too much flexing and tire overloading. When your tires are inflated to the recommended PSI, you enjoy their optimum life and performance.

Question: What Do I Have To Do When I Knock A Pedestrian?
Answer: It is absolutely imperative that you do not flee the scene if you have struck a pedestrian with your vehicle. This could lead to a hit and run charge in addition to hitting a pedestrian. Immediately stop your vehicle in a safe area and call 911. Render any aid you are capable of, and ask any witnesses to remain on the scene. If the pedestrian is conscious and able, exchange relevant information such as names, phone numbers, and insurance providers. - Once the police arrive, give your statement, but do not admit or imply fault to anyone. This includes apologizing and stating that you did not see the pedestrian. If you are allowed to, take photos of any damages, as well as the surrounding area and any injuries. Speak to an attorney as soon as possible, as they will be able to further advise you. Finally, report the incident to your insurance provider. You will generally have thirty days to do so, and your attorney can guide you through this process. - Unless stated in a state’s statutes, ordinances, or road signs, pedestrians may cross either directly or diagonally at any point in the road. If a pedestrian is found guilty of jaywalking, they could be found at least partially at fault for an accident involving a vehicle hitting them. Many laws have restricted pedestrian crossing to crosswalks, and only at right angles.

Question: What If I Accidentally Get Into A Minor Accident Eg Hit A?
Answer: Crashing during a test drive The driver has to take responsibility for the accident, which goes without saying. Even though the driver may argue that the vehicle is the dealership’s property and thus is under their jurisdiction, the fact remains that transferred temporary responsibility has been transferred to the test driver during the test drive. That means that the test driver must deal with the consequences of the accident through the dealer’s policy and bear any ancillary costs. Depending on the nature of the accident, the dealer might suggest for the offending customer to purchase the vehicle, even though they are not legally obliged to do so. By doing so, the repairs for the vehicle will be your responsibility – you are now the owner of the car! Generally, accidents that occur during a test drive are usually fairly minor. If the damages are pretty substantial then the right thing to do will be to absorb the damages and purchase the car. If the damage is too great, however, it would be unwise to purchase the car (or what’s left of the car) – do not let the dealership coerce you into making this one-sided deal. What about the dealership’s insurance coverage? Any dealer worth his or her weight in salt who sends a potential customer on a test drive will compel the test driver to sign forms, which transfers responsibility of all damages to the vehicle to the driver. If the car is involved in a serious accident, or if the test-driver refuses to purchase the vehicle, the dealership will invoke their insurance’s coverage. However, the test-driver will still be required to pay a set amount for the damages he caused, usually calculated by the amount of deductibles that was set aside for the test-driven vehicle. Using the test-driver’s own insurance coverage Often, the dealership will suggest for the test driver to make a claim from their own policy rather than from of the dealers. This move is not unprecedented, especially if the test-driver was alone in the test-driven vehicle at the time of the accident. However, the test-driver should think this through very carefully and consult with their insurance company before making any commitments. They will have to ensure that their insurance coverage extends to vehicles that are not owned by them. A baseless claim may even be viewed by insurance companies as fraudulent claims, and will result in even more trouble for the test-driver. Still, there are many smaller dealers that do not purchase insurance for their vehicles, because of the hefty premiums and deductibles they will have to shoulder. This is where you should think twice before even entering this dealership – if the dealership cannot even spend to protect its fleet of vehicles, what makes it reliable? Even if it means walking away from your dream car, you should not take the risk of driving a car that is completely uninsured – if you’re lucky, you’ll be able to use your own insurance coverage in the case of a test-drive accident. Even then, such measures are unnecessary if the dealer has coverage for its fleet of vehicles. The Final Word On Crashing During A Test Drive Being involved in an accident during a test drive must be everyone’s nightmare, but this nightmare can be cut short if you’re dealing with an honest, reputable dealer. However, there are always a few black sheeps in any industry who will force you into the purchase of the damaged vehicle because of the lack of insurance coverage on their fleet of vehicles. As such, when test-driving the vehicle of your choice, the test driver must insist in finding out whether the dealer has purchased insurance coverage for the test-driven car. Car insurance that covers potential owners in the event of a test-drive accident is the least of what car dealerships can do to protect their own vehicles. Dealerships who attempt to put the onus on potential buyers during a test drive show lack of professionalism – this may reflect bad work ethics or bad management, and you will do well to stay clear of these dodgy car dealerships

Question: Which Car Brands Are The Most Fuel Efficient?
Answer: While some car brands may be associated with being fuel-efficient—Toyota seems to spring to mind for many—fuel economy is primarily a function of engine efficiency. Which basically means that it all depends on the type of car and the type of engine it has. If you want maximum fuel efficiency in a gasoline engine, then the small hatchbacks and subcompact sedans with their small engines are for you. Needless to say, the bigger the car, the bigger its engines gets; ergo, the lower its fuel economy will be. The fuel efficiency champions, however (at least those you can buy off a dealership now), are the hybrids and those with diesel engines—particularly ones with state-of-the-art common-rail direct-injection (CRDi) diesel engines. So far, only Toyota, Lexus, and Honda offer hybrids locally. Passengers cars with CRDi engines range from most of the luxury brands (Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo) to the Hyundai Accent Hatchback. All pickups and most SUVs (Montero Sport, Fortuner, Alterra, Everest, Tucson, Santa Fe, Sportage, Sorento) come with CRDi motors as well. (Apologies to those I’ve missed.) Special mention goes to the newer gasoline engines of some Mazda models, which with their SKYACTIV technology, boast compression ratios as high as those of diesel engines, endowing these cars with fuel efficiency higher than that of most traditional gasoline engines.

Question: What Is The Procedure To Renew My Coe For My Motorcycle?
Answer: In summary, you’ll have to pay the Prevailing Quota Premium (PQP) for your vehicle category to renew your COE. PQP is the moving average of COE prices in the last 3 months. It varies monthly depending on the COE prices in the bidding exercises conducted in the last 3 months. You can renew your CEO for a period of 5 or 10 years. If you want to renew your vehicle for 5 years, you need to pay 50% of the PQP. However, vehicles under Categories A to D can only renew its COE for 5 years once and when the 5-year renewal period is over, it cannot be renewed and your vehicle would have to be deregistered. Motorcycles fall under Category D. If you’re renewing for 10 years, you’ll have to pay the full price of PQP. If you are looking to reloan your motorcycle COE, do head to this article for more information. https://www.motorist.sg/article/718/5-things-you-should-know-before-renewing-your-motorcycle-coe There’s no limit to how many times you can renew your COE in 10-year periods for vehicles with no statutory life spans (i.e Categories A, B, D). Vehicles that have reached the end of their statutory lifespan can no longer renew their COE. There are 3 ways to renew your COE. 1. Online a. You will need a sufficient amount in your bank account, and the payment limit for the amount you are paying. b. An Internet Banking Account with Citibank, DBS, POSB, OCBC Plus!, Standard Chartered Bank or UOB (eNets Debit) - Renew your COE here: https://vrl.lta.gov.sg/lta/vrl/action/pubfunc?ID=RenewCOE 2. By post. a. Complete the application form and mail it with your PQP payment to the following address: Land Transport Authority (LTA) 10 Sin Ming Drive Singapore 575701 Ensure that your form and payment reach LTA before your COE expires If you are paying by cheque, make the cheque payable to "LAND TRANSPORT AUTHORITY" and cross "A/C Payee Only". Please write your vehicle number(s) and contact number on the reverse side of your cheque. Post-dated cheques will not be accepted. If your COE has expired, LTA only accepts cashier's orders. Please do not send cash payment by post. The COE renewal application date is the date that LTA receives the application. The PQP rates you pay will be based on the application date or the COE expiry date, whichever is earlier. If LTA has not received the application, showing that you have mailed it out does not count as proof of the application. 3. At LTA Customer Service Centre a.

The only time you can purchase a new car with 100% loan is for a commercial vehicle or private hire vehicle.

Question: Why Are The Speed Limits For Light Commercial Vehicles?
Answer: The higher speed limit would allow light commercial vehicles to travel at higher speeds and narrow their speed differential with other vehicles that have higher speed limits. This would improve the traffic flow on expressways without compromising road safety. However, these vehicles, as with other vehicles, would still be subjected to the posted speed limits on the roads. For safety reasons, light goods vehicles carrying workers on the vehicles' cargo decks/compartments and small buses without seat belts for passengers will continue to be subjected to the speed limit of 60km/h.

Question: What Is Prevailing Quota Premium Pqp?
Answer: In Singapore, all vehicles require a Certificate of Entitlement (COE). The price of the COE for a particular vehicle is termed the "Quota Premium" (QP). You may also have encountered the term "Prevailing Quota Premium" (PQP). What does this term mean and how is it different from the QP? The term PQP refers to the amount required to extend or renew the COE for a vehicle already in use. Unlike buying a new vehicle, one does not need to bid for COE when buying a used vehicle; instead, all you need to do is to pay the PQP and the COE will be extended or renewed. You can also get the lowest COE Renewal Loan here! https://www.motorist.sg/coe-renewal COEs for Off-Peak Cars (OPC) can also be renewed. In such cases, the PQP will be of the same value as that of a normal car. No COE rebates are available for OPC during renewal. The PQP is calculated based on the moving average of the QP in the last 3 months. For all vehicle categories, the COE may be renewed for a period of either 5 or 10 years. COEs which have been renewed for a period of 5 years are not eligible for another renewal and will have to be de-registered after they expire. Otherwise, there is no limit to the number of times for renewal.

Question: When Do I Need Go For My Car Inspection?
Answer: Hi Joe! In Singapore, vehicle owners are required to send their vehicles for regular vehicle inspections to ensure that they maintain their vehicles in roadworthy conditions to minimise potential hazards to all road users. The frequency of inspection increases as the vehicle becomes older. Cars aged 3 to 10 years old would have to go for inspection every 2 years or if it’s aged more than 10 years, it has to be inspected annually. Any vehicle that does not pass the inspection will not be able to renew its road tax and, hence, will not be allowed for use on the roads.

Question: What Would Be The Procedure To Re License My Vehicle That I?
Answer: Vehicle owners who are not using their vehicle for a period of time can apply to the Land Transport Authority (LTA) to place their vehicle under lay-up status for up to 1 year (and can be renewed yearly for up to 3 consecutive years). During the period, where the vehicle is laid-up, the vehicle cannot be driven on public roads and is required to be garaged at its reported garage address. Please inform LTA in writing prior to any change of garage address, as it is an offence not to do so. If the vehicle is not re-licensed by the third year, the vehicle will be deregistered at the end of the third year. Please note that there will be no backdating of lay-up commencement date. Any outstanding road tax and applicable late payment fee before the lay-up commencement date is payable. For your further information that, if the vehicle is eligible for Preferential Additional Registration Fee (PARF), it will lose its PARF eligibility once the vehicle is placed under lay-up status. A lay-up vehicle must pass a vehicle inspection at any LTA-authorised inspection centre before it could be re-licensed. Once the vehicle has fulfilled all the road tax pre-requisite(s), i.e. has valid motor insurance and passed vehicle inspection, you may re-license the vehicle at any of the following channels: - Internet (www.onemotoring.com.sg) LTA-authorised Road Tax Collection Centres

Question: When Should I Change My Transmission Fluid?
Answer: The Automatic Transmission Rebuilders Association (ATRA) recommends changing your transmission fluid every 50,000 km, or two years. You can confirm this in your vehicle’s owner’s manual. There you will find a recommended schedule directly from the manufacturer. If you keep to this schedule, your transmission will last long and perform more efficiently. Transmission fluid deteriorates over time, especially with certain types of driving. If you do a lot of towing, hauling heavy equipment or if you make frequent stop-and-go-type trips in the city, your transmission fluid may be working on overdrive. When transmission fluid deteriorates, it’s not able to do its job properly. It won’t be able to cool the transmission, lubricate its parts, or help necessitate smooth gear changes. This can lead to costly repairs in the future. Performing regular transmission fluid changes will save you money in the long run.

Question: Is Using A Knob On Steering Wheel Considered Illegal?
Answer: We do not allow the installation and use of knob on steering wheel as drivers may tend to over-rely on the steering knob when negotiating a turn or manoeuvring the vehicle. This could result in losing control of the vehicle in an emergency occurrence and affecting the safety of the vehicle occupant and other road user. In additional, the knob may also cause severe injury to the driver in the event of an accident when the collision forced the driver against the knob or vice-versa. On the contrary, we would urge drivers to use hand controls when manoeuvring with the steering wheel for better control of their vehicles

Question: Do I Need To Get My Lorry Inspected After Installing?
Answer: After installing the canopy, vehicle owners are required to produce their vehicles for a “change-of-vehicle-particulars (CVP)” inspection at LTA’s authorised vehicle inspection centres. Inspectors at the inspection centres will inspect the canopy structure and re-weigh the vehicle. The inspection centre will also update LTA on the lorry’s unladen weight and particulars. A fee of $73 (excluding GST) is payable to the inspection centre for CVP inspection and weighing. The LTA-authorised vehicle inspection centres that provide both CVP inspection and weighing services are VICOM Inspection Centre Pte Ltd at 385 Sin Ming Drive, STA Inspection Pte Ltd at 302 Sin Ming Road and 249 Jalan Boon Lay, and JIC Inspection Services Pte Ltd at 53 Pioneer Road. Enforcement officers are not everywhere at all times. Hence, there would still be owners and drivers of lorries that will flout safety regulations when carrying workers. How is LTA going to address this? Everyone has a shared responsibility to make journeys safer for workers. Government’s commitment is through implementing and enforcing the set of stringent measures as well as to continue to look into ways to improve safe driving practices. Employers have the legal and moral responsibilities to ensure the welfare and safety of their workers. Similarly, lorry drivers need to exercise care for their passengers and observe safe driving habits. The public can also help by calling LTA’s Hotline to report any instances of non-compliance spotted on the roads.  LTA

Question: What Are The Reasons That Causes Dashboard Cracks?
Answer: Automobile dashboards are composed of several layers of plastics. The top layer in older automobile dashboards is usually made from polyvinyl chloride, commonly called PVC. PVC can crack after a few years of exposure to sunlight and heat if not properly maintained and protected. The dashboards of older cars, especially classics, tend to become brittle and crack after many years of exposure to the sun. 1. Ultraviolet Light The most common cause of dashboard cracks is exposure to ultraviolet light. Ultraviolet light is harmful to the chemical components of plastics such as PVC. Over time, ultraviolet light can evaporate oils and break down the plastic molecules. If regularly exposed to ultraviolet light, the dashboard plastic will become dry and crack. 2. Heat Extended exposure to heat, such as parking the car in the open and exposing the dash to sunlight through the windshield, can break down the chemical molecules in the dashboard. The interior of a car can exceed 100 F on a sunny day after about one hour of exposure. Dashboards that have a dry, dusty or powdery appearance have been damaged by heat and ultraviolet light. 3. Repairs Small cracks can be repaired. The entire dashboard must be replaced if the cracks are deep and long. The dashboard should be replaced if the cracks have a spider web appearance. Filling the crack with silicon or using a dashboard crack repair kit, available at most auto parts stores, is a temporary fix. The crack will probably reappear in a couple of years, especially if the dashboard is exposed to heat and sunlight. 4. Prevention Prevent cracks in a dashboard by protecting it from ultraviolet light and extreme heat. Park the car inside a garage or in a shady location. Use a windshield screen or a car cover year-round to block sunlight and prevent damage. Apply a moisturizing treatment to the dashboard to prevent the PVC from drying out. Select a treatment that contains a sunscreen to block ultraviolet light.

Question: Any Ways We Can Enter Sentosa Island For Free The Per?
Answer: Unfortunately, there isn't. The entrance fee to Sentosa Island ranges from $2 to $6 per entry, depending on the day and time. The cheapest time slot is during lunch (12nn to 2pm) and dinner (5pm to 7pm), when it's only $2 per entry. Otherwise, it's pricey at $6 per entry. However, if you're a frequent visitor to Sentosa. I'd recommend getting the Sentosa Islander Membership which entitles you FREE entry into Sentosa via the Sentosa Boardwalk, Sentosa Express and Sentosa Gantry (drive-in). The annual pass costs $25 per year and assuming you drive there on the weekends when the entrance fee is $6, you only need to drive to Sentosa more than 4 times a year to make your money's worth. After your first year, renewal is only $20. The individual membership is non-transferrable though, and only entitles one car and one person to the entrance fee waivers. If you’re a dad or mum, get the family membership ($50) instead. You’ll be the main cardholder and your children/relatives will be the supplementary members. (up to 4 pax, immediate family members only).

Question: Is It An Offence To Turn On The Fog Lamps When Driving At?
Answer: Under normal weather conditions, be it in the day or at night, there is no need to switch on the fog lamps. This is because the light emitted from vehicle headlamps is sufficient to illuminate the road ahead. Switching on front fog lamps will not further improve forward vision under clear weather conditions. Some drivers have provided feedback that front fog lamps, when switched on indiscriminately, are intimidating and cause added stress to the driver in front. Switching on rear fog lamps unnecessarily may also cause confusion to motorists travelling behind you as the intense red light emitted could be mistaken as the brake light. Motorists who abuse the use of fog lamps are liable, upon conviction, to a fine of up to $1,000 or a jail term of up to three months for first offence. Repeat offenders are liable, upon conviction, to a fine of up to $2,000 or a jail term of up to six months.

Question: My Uncle Passed On And Need To Scrap His Motor Bike Kindly?
Answer: Hi Eugene, thanks for leaving a question. Our deepest condolences to you are your family. In order to deregister your uncle's motorcycle, you will need to need to apply for a Grant of Probate (if there is a Will) or Grant of Letters of Administration (in Intestacy) that will authorize you to deal with the deceased's assets. Kindly note that Grant of Probate is usually given to direct family members, and the process is more complicated if you are not directly related to the deceased. With the authorization letter, the representative can then proceed to LTA to de-register the vehicle or transfer its ownership.

Question: I Have Made A Successful Bid For The Coe Can I Cancel My?
Answer: A Temporary Certificate of Entitlement (TCOE) cannot be cancelled. The TCOE is the result of a successful bid which not only contributes to the setting of the COE Quota Premium but also deprives another person from obtaining a COE at the same exercise. Hence, prospective vehicle owner must be prepared to utilise the TCOE that is successfully bid under his/her name to register the vehicle before the TCOE expiry date. If the owner chooses not to utilise the TCOE for whatever reason, the bid deposit would be forfeited.

Question: What Is The Expected Lifespan Of My Car 39 S Battery?
Answer: The life expectancy for your car battery is typically between four to six years. Several factors determine how long your battery will last, for example weather conditions, vehicle type and driving habits. There are, however, several key pointers you can utilise to help increase the life expectancy of your car battery. WHY IS MY BATTERY FLAT? Make sure to check all of the electrical connections and ensure the battery is kept clean and dry. If corrosion has built up over time, baking soda in a water solution and an old toothbrush is ideal to clean the battery terminals. Just make sure to remove the negative terminal first. When reapplying the terminals, connect the positive terminal first. Frequent, short car trips contribute to an earlier lifespan for car batteries. It takes roughly eight hours of continuous driving for the alternator to fully charge the battery. If the battery infrequently receives a full charge, strong crystalline deposits can form on the negative plates and consequently prevents the battery from charging properly – this is called sulphation. If short car trips are a part of your daily routine, avoid using electric auxiliary controls unnecessarily – this will prolong the lifespan of the battery and also save on fuel. If your car isn’t in use for long periods of time, removing the negative battery connection during periods of non-use assists in the longevity of your battery. Just make sure to reconnect the terminal before attempting to start the car. The electrolyte (acid/water) solution levels may be low. If your battery is not maintenance-free, you may need to adjust the solution levels. If the levels are low, be sure to use the necessary safety precautions when you are handling battery acid. Only use distilled water, or you will damage the battery.
